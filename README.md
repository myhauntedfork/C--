## Overview

C-- is a simple programming language designed for educational purposes and to explore the concepts of language design, parsing, and interpretation. This project implements a lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, and code generator, allowing users to write and execute basic programs. 

**Note**: This project is currently a work in progress. While the core functionality is implemented, additional features and improvements will be added over time. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## Features

- Lexer: Tokenizes input code into a stream of tokens.
- Parser: Constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) from the token stream.
- Semantic Analyzer: Performs type checking and variable scope analysis.
- Code Generator: Converts the AST into executable code.
